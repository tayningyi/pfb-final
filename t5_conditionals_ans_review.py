# Create a function `height_func()` to convert height in metres to feet.
# The function will ask for a user to input the height.
# You can use: user_input = float(input("Enter your height in metres : ")) to ask user to input height.
# If the input is string data type, the program should print: "Your input is invalid, please try again".
# If a user input is float or integer data type, the program will convert input height to feet 
# and print: "Your height of ___ in metre is ____ in feet." 
# Note that 1 metre = 3.28084 feet.
# The function will loop endlessly, prompting the user to input height until the correct data type is entered.
# The function does not take in any parameters.
# Here is how the program will look like when executed:

    ## Enter your height in metres: two  (user input height as "two")
    ## Your input is invalid, please try again
    ## Enter your height in metres: TWO  (user input height as "TWO")
    ## Your input is invalid, please try again
